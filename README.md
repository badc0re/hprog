# Hel programming language
This is a functional language.

Philosophy
- Code should be readable
- No states, only transformations
- Everything is a function except variables
- Variables are immutable
- Functions can be referenced by aliases

Lexer (todo):
- Change handling of error messages, instead of bools, use a wrapper for the errors
- Parsing numbers
    - No double
    - No negative
- parsing print stuff
    - not implemented
- how to use print?
- 1..10 (ranges)
    - not implemented
- .11 floats starting with dot
    - not allowed

Parse (todo):
- not even started
- Types
