# Hell programming language
This is a functional language.

Why not as Lisp?
Why Lisp at all, I simply can't follow all the brackets.
I want to switch functions with placeholers please

Lexer (todo):
- Change handling of error messages, instead of bools, use a wrapper for the errors
- Parsing numbers
    - No double
- parsing print stuff
- how to use print?
- 1..10 (ranges)
- .11 floats starting with dot
    - not allowed

Parse (todo):
- not even started
